# JOINS

We talked about these in class again, and they are most useful when trying to connect data together from two different tables and are either linked together or we are looking something up from another table.

## INNER JOIN

The basic syntax is as follows:

SELECT * FROM [table name] INNER JOIN [other table]
ON [table name].columnname = [other table].columnname;

- keep in mind the columname must match in type and it should relate to one another.
- also note that as you join more tables, the query gets slower.

Example:

We decided it would be best to split the pets table into two tables so that the type of the pet is separate so that we can keep better control over what is stored in the database. 

```sql

SELECT name, dob, breed, type, licenseNumber FROM pets
INNER JOIN animalTypes.typeID = pets.typeID
ORDER BY PetName;

```
What other column should be in a separate table?
