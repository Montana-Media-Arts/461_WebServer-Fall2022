# Design

## Identify from Specifications

When we look at a specifications document or what our client or assignment requires, we can use some visual clues to determine how to create our databse tables.

## Nouns

If you look at nouns of the specifications, you can often find what the table names should be.  For example, if we have a specification that says something like, we need an application that stores information about different games that are played, we can derive that we need a table called `Games`.

## Adjectives

When we look at the specifications document, we may find that their is a description of the game like, genre, multiplayer, gamer tags, etc. and that information can be used to create the columns in our `Games` table.
