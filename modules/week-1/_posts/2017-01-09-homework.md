# Homework

This week we introduced server-side and client-side programming and how they interact.

Specifics: 

1. Write a short paper about your thoughts on the two.  Is one more important than the other?  What is the most important aspect when it comes to their interaction?
2. Upload your short paper into your GitHub repository.
3. Take a screen shot of your completed syllabus quiz and upload that to your repository.
4. Turn in your repository link into Moodle.
