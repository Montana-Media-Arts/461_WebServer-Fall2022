# How they Work Together

<p>Web development is all about communication and data exchange. This communication takes place via two parties over the HTTP protocol.</p>
 
<p>These parties are: </p>

### Server
 
<p>The Server is responsible for serving the web pages depending on the client/end-user requirement. It can be either static or dynamic.</p>

### Client
 
<p>A client is a party that requests pages from the server and displays them to the end-user. In general a client program is a web browser.</p>
 
<p>Example | Working</p>
 
<p>We can explain this entire mechanism using the following:</p>
<p>The user opens his web browser (client)</p>
<p>The user starts browsing</p>
 
<p>(for example http://c-sharpcorner.com)<p>
 
<p>The client forwards this request to the server, for accessing their web page.
The server then acknowledges the request and replies back to the client program.</p>
 
<p>(An access link to that web page)</p>

<p>The client then receives the page source and renders it.</p>
 
<p>(Into a viewable/under a stable website)</p>
 
* Now the user types into the search bar
* The client then submits data to the server
* The server processes the data and replies back with a related search result
* The client again renders it back for the user's view
* The user gets access to the requested link.
