# DOM-based attacks

The two types of XSS vulnerabilities described above have something in common: the web page with embedded JavaScript is formed on the server side. However, the client frameworks used in modern web applications allow changing a web page without accessing the server. The document object model can be modified directly on the client side.

The main premise behind this vulnerability remains the same: specifically, poorly implemented processing of HTML escape sequences. This leads to attacker-controlled JavaScript appearing in the text of a web page. Then this code is executed in the server context.

Example of DOM-based attacks
Here is code for exploiting this type of vulnerability:

    
```html
<div id="message-text">This is a warning alert</div>
```

The HTML code has an element with the "message-text" identifier, meaning that it is used to display the text of a message. The DOM tree is then modified by the following JavaScript function:

    
```js
function warning(message) {
    $("#message-text").html(message);
    $("#message").prop('style', 'display:inherit');
}    
```

The script displays the message with the html() function, which doesn't sanitize HTML escape sequences. Therefore, such an implementation is vulnerable. For example, the following could be passed to this function:

```js
<script> alert ("XSS") </script>
```

In this case, the script will be executed in the server context.
