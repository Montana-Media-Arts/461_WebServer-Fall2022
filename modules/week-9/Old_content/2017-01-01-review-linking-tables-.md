# Linking Tables

Suppose you need to store information about swimmers and their competitions.  You need to keep track of the athelete, what competitions they attended and what events they were in.  How are you going to do it?

Think of it in three tables and then create linking tables from there.

1. Athletes
2. Competitions
3. Events

What linking tables are required to answer the following questions:

1. What competitions did the athlete attend?
2. What events did the athlete compete in at a certain competition?
3. What events were available at certain competitions?
