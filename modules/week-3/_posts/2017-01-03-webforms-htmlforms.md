# WebForms

This is one way in which Microsoft creates web applications. There are other techniques, but they use the same premise and so that is why we look at webforms since they are similar to other technologies in which we have used.

These web forms are evaluated on the server and then rendered as HTML forms.

However, it allows us to access the data in the code behind using intellisense.

# HTML Forms

For PHP, we can use HTML forms and gather the information directly with server code.
