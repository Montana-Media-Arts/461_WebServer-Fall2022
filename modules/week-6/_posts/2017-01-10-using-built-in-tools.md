# Built-in Tools

With Visual Studio, you can use their Data Tools to connect, retrieve and display data.

## Visual Studio Tools

First, we want to drag on a sqldatasource component and configure it.

<img src="../imgs/Step1.png" />

Then, we can select a new connection.

<img src="../imgs/Step2.png" />

Next, we want to choose SQL Server and connect to it.

<img src="../imgs/Step3.png" />

For the connection, we will use our localhost, but it could be an external server or a server on your network.  Then, we can connect to a specific database and test the connection.

Then, we can select the connection string that was just created.

<img src="../imgs/Step5.png" />

We can name the connection string and save it.

Then, we can create all the basic queries as well.

<img src="../imgs/Step7.png" />

We can test the query to ensure that it returns what we expect.

After dragging in a GridView component, we can connect to the sqldatasrouce that was just configured.

<img src="../imgs/Step9.png" />

After connecting to the data source, the GridView looks like this.

<img src="../imgs/Step10.png" />

This is the end result!
