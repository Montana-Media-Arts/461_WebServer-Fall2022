# Implementation

At this point, we should be able to not only design, but then implement our actual designs.  Once we have a good sense of what we want to store and how we want to store it, we can implement it in SQL Server Management Studio or MySQL Workbench.

## MS SQL Server

Remember, we can create databases through the interface, by right-clicking and selecting Create Database. Once, it's been created, you can add database objects such as tables.

Right-click the database, and select create table.

From here, we can specify the columns, the type and whether it's a primary key, the identity specification and how it should autoincrement.

<!--
## MySQL

We can work similarily in MySQL Workbench by creating a schema.  After right-clicking to create a schema, we can right-click the schema and create a new table.

In the table dialog window, we can add columns, their data types and select primary key, autoincrement, not null, and more.

Once our tables are generated, we can write T-SQL statements to select, insert, update, delete information.-->
